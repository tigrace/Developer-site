                <p> Making the world a fun place is one of the things i enjoy doing,
                    but everything starts out blank, empty before been acted upon,
                    interesting thing is that i enjoy that planeness that gives birth to 
                    something new, making me enjoy the mystery in black and white color.
                    most innovations happened in life, through the click of keyboards and
                    a blank screen, sometimes exceptions is all you need to push that vibe, 
                    a drink might be what does it for you, or games, or hanging out with 
                    friends, or staying all by yourself a lone ranger like me and you get
                    inspired, and also not forgetting love, hate, peace, anger, violence, strife,
                    pleasure, partying and all sorts that can trigger that link between you 
                    and a new born innovations or ideas and everything will be spontaneous 
                    and very beautiful. a birth to a new beginning and a new born.

                 <p> we make use of different things that make a difference in our
                     life, most of the times, we can power in our hands without knowing
                     and we misuse the power majority of the time, sometimes we need to 
                     go through cleansing an activate our inner strength, in which lays 
                     our power to make our world a beautiful place.
